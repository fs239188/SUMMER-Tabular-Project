<u>BRIEF OVERVIEW</u>- While reading about this dataset, I found that it is synthetic (created by using algorithms and simulations based on generative artificial intelligence technologies) which explains certain inconsistencies. The Predict Health Outcomes of Horses project is dedicated to a multi-class classification challenge. The target variable is the horse's outcome, which makes it a nominal dataset.  

Definition of the challenge: The challenge is defined by kaggle and its objective is to apply machine learning to predict the smoking status of an individual based on bio-signals. Machine learning will enable us to see different factors associated with the smoking status of an individual. The data is tabular(a comma separated file) with 29.2 MB. The dataset provides Information about different individuals. Information like age, height in cm weight in kg.. etc The machine task is supervised specifically binary classification.
