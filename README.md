*DATA*  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e22/data?select=train.csv  


BRIEF OVERVIEW- While reading about this dataset, I found that it is synthetic (created by using algorithms and simulations based on generative artificial intelligence technologies) which explains certain inconsistencies. The Predict Health Outcomes of Horses project is dedicated to a multi-class classification challenge. The target variable is the horse's outcome, which makes it a nominal dataset.  

Definition of the challenge: The challenge is defined by kaggle and its objective is to apply machine learning to predict the outcome of horses based on various info given about each horse. Machine learning will enable us to see accurately what features define their outcome and efficiently match up the initial data outcome . This data is tabular, also comma separated with 377.52KB. The dataset provides Information about different individuals. Information like age, rectal temp, pulse, respiratory rate, temp of extremities, etc  



## *Software Setup*
Library: numpy, scikit learn, pandas, matplotlib,spicy stats.
