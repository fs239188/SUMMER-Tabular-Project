BRIEF OVERVIEW- While reading about this dataset, I found that it is synthetic (created by using algorithms and simulations based on generative artificial intelligence technologies) which explains certain inconsistencies. The Predict Health Outcomes of Horses project is dedicated to a multi-class classification challenge. The target variable is the horse's outcome, which makes it a nominal dataset.
